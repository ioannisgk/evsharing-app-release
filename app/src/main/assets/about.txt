This mobile application is part of the Dissertation Project for the Bsc Degree in Computing (University of Northampton).

A user can register an account, login and request a vehicle for a short trip from a car sharing service that utilizes Electric Vehicles.

EV Sharing App was developed and submitted to Google Store for educational and testing purposes, so it is not used by a company in real time.
